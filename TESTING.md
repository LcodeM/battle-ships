# Testing 

The following document outlines the testing protocols undertaken to ensure that all code was valid, as well as outlining any and all existing and solved bugs.

## Validation

Using the Code Institutes online Python Linter tool, all code was validated upon first try, with the exception of line 7, where the code line was too long. This was fixed by continuing the code on a new line.

![Line 7 validation]()

This issue then proceded to show an error of trailing white space in the linter, but this should not effect the function or performance of the program.
