## Introduction

Let's Get Quizzical is a general knowledge quiz, with a friendly and simple design, aimed at testing the user's knowledge across a variety of topics with questions ranging in difficulty.

The game is designed to display whether the user has chosen a correct or incorrect answer on click, and preventing them from choosing multiple answers to cheat. Scores are tracked as the user progresses through the questions, with a final score displayed at the end, as well as the option to play again.

Users should enjoy the different question topics, and aim to want to beat their previous score, where possible.
